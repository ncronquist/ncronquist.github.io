### SAP Concur

- Software Design Engineer
- Aug 2015 - Sept 2019
- Bellevue, WA

Worked on multiple teams designing and building highly available distributed
systems with end-to-end ownership of services. Projects focused on moving Concur
from a monolithic architecture to a service oriented architecture. Promoted
automation of tests, builds, and deployments on all projects to increase
velocity and improve confidence in changes. Mentored junior developers and
conducted technical hiring interviews.

_Client Data Services (CDS)_: GraphQL PaaS allowing developers to deploy small
pieces of a GraphQL schema. Contributed to all parts of the CDS platform
including the base engine and local emulator written in NodeJS, management CLI
written in Golang, and the AWS and Kubernetes infrastructure. Implemented the
initial resolver stitching and added support for remote schemas; a key part of
the local emulator.

_Orchestration_: GraphQL service exposing Concur API data to Concur UI teams.
Organized a complex data model into an easier to consume view model. Used view
model designs to create a GraphQL schema and associated resolver code written
in Elixir. Improved the reliability of the service through better automation
and monitoring, support for asynchronous mutations, and more resilient code
handling of upstream API requests.

_Receipts_: HATEOS driven REST API that manages receipts at Concur. Implemented
queuing and event processing for all I/O actions to improve fault tolerance and
to increase performance through parallel processing. Improved image generation
process and built functional tests that greatly reduced bug frequency. Automated
Kubernetes deployments dealing with both stateful and stateless resources.
