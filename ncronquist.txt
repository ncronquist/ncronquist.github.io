Employment
----------


### SAP Concur

- Software Design Engineer
- Aug 2015 - Current
- Bellevue, WA

Worked on multiple teams designing and building distributed systems with
end-to-end ownership of services. Projects focused on moving Concur from a
monolithic architecture to a service oriented architecture. Promoted automation
of tests, builds, and deployments on all projects to increase velocity and
improve confidence in changes. Mentored junior developers and conducted
technical hiring interviews.

_Client Data Services (CDS)_

GraphQL PaaS allowing developers to deploy small pieces of a GraphQL schema.
Contributed to all parts of the CDS platform including the base engine and
local emulator written in NodeJS, management CLI written in Golang, and the
AWS and Kubernetes infrastructure. Implemented the initial resolver stitching
and added support for remote schemas; a key part of the local emulator.

_Orchestration_

GraphQL service exposing Concur API data to the Concur UI teams. Organized a
complex data model into an easier to consume view model. Used view model
designs to create a GraphQL schema and associated resolver code written in
Elixir. Improved the reliability of the service through better automation and
monitoring, support for asynchronous mutations, and more resilient code handling
of upstream API requests.

_Receipts_

HATEOS driven REST API that manages receipts at Concur. Implemented queuing and
event processing for all I/O actions to improve fault tolerance and to increase
performance through parallel processing. Improved image generation process and
built functional tests that greatly reduced bug frequency. Automated Kubernetes
deployments dealing with both stateful and stateless resources. Managed date,
time, and other globalization issues for a service used by clients around the
world.
